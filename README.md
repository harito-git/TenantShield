## 📖 About The Project

TenantShield is an award-winning web application that empowers tenants to identify potential lease violations, understand their rights, and take informed action. Take a photo. Know your rights. Get justice.

Housing disputes can be overwhelming. TenantShield bridges the gap by using AI to analyze evidence and provide instant legal context. Users can upload photos of issues like mold, pests, or damage, and our platform generates a detailed report including applicable local laws, recommended actions, and even a draft message to their landlord.

Built for the CSHub Hack Day, TenantShield won **🥇 1st Place ($400)** and the **🏆 Best Use of Gemini AI** award.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📸 AI-Powered Analysis** – Uses Gemini Multimodal capabilities to analyze images and text descriptions of housing issues
- **📍 Location-Aware Justice** – Leverages user location to cite specific, relevant local housing laws and ordinances
- **📑 Comprehensive Reporting** – Generates detailed reports covering tenant rights, legal citations, and next steps
- **✉️ Automated Drafts** – Creates pre-written, professional messages for users to send to their landlords
- **⚖️ Legal Aid Locator** – Identifies and displays nearby legal aid clinics on a map
- **📱 Streamlined Interface** – Intuitive, step-by-step form for uploading evidence and describing problems
